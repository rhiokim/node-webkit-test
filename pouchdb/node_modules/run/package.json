  "readme": "## Install\n\n`$ npm -g install run`\n\n## Usage\n\n`$ runjs yourcode.js`\n\n# What does it do?\n\n`runjs` will rerun server.js whenever one of the watched files is\nchanged. It ignores files in your `.gitignore`.\n\n    $ runjs server.js\n    Watching /Dropbox/dev/server.js and all sub-directories not excluded by your .gitignore\n    Found & ignored file.db ; is dotfile or has ignored extension\n\n    Starting: server.js\n    > Listening on http://localhost:8888/\n\nNo more switching to the terminal to rerun your code. Just change a file and\nyour code will be rerun.\n\nThis is especially nice for web-servers, as you can skip the terminal and\nalt-tab to the browser to see your updated code happily running.\n\n### Features\n- supports globs in .gitignore (e.g. `*.log`)\n- any arguments, including debug arguments, are relayed to your code\n- **stdin is relayed to your code** [not supported by nodemon as of 12/5/11]\n- files and directories in `.gitignore` are not watched, neither are dotfiles.\n- coffeescript is supported: `runjs yourcode.coffee`\n  (by [rockymeza](https://github.com/rockymeza))\n\nSource at [github.com/DTrejo/run.js](https://github.com/DTrejo/run.js)\n\n---\n![Screenshot of runjs](https://github.com/DTrejo/run.js/raw/master/test/screenshot.png)\n\n### Contributors\nOrdered by date of first contribution.\n[Auto-generated](http://github.com/dtrejo/node-authors) on Wed Aug 08 2012 20:27:26 GMT-0700 (PDT).\n\n- [David Trejo aka `DTrejo`](https://github.com/DTrejo)\n- [Rocky Meza aka `rockymeza`](https://github.com/rockymeza)\n- [Shani Elharrar aka `morishani`](https://github.com/morishani)\n- [Andrew Sutherland aka `asuth`](https://github.com/asuth)\n",
